// Add your domain model below

As a supermarket shopper,
So that I can pay for items at checkout items,
I'd like to be able to know the total cost of items in my basket.

As an organised individual,
So that I can evaluate my shopping habits,
I'd like to see a receipt that includes line items (quantity, name, cost) and the total cost.

[] Add the following to the file domain-model.md
[] Write down all the nouns and then all the verbs in the User Stories
[] Draw a table like the first one above and add information regarding Methods, Inputs, Scenarios, and Outputs within the table
[] Add a column Data that describes more about the data you need for what you need for an item in the basket
[] Show it to someone in your cohort or coach and see if it makes sense to them.

Further work
[] There are different ways to model domains. Find another way to do it: investigate more techniques.
[] Analyse - How would this change in OOP?
[] Convert your domain model into a set of tests and show this to a teacher.
[] Once you have your tests written, write source code to make them pass
